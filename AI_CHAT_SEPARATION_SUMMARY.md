# AI Chat Separation Implementation Summary

## Changes Made:

### 1. **New State Variables**
```javascript
const [chatIncident, setChatIncident] = useState(null);
const [chatMode, setChatMode] = useState('general');
```

### 2. **Added AI Chat Button in Actions Column**
- Purple button (#8b5cf6) next to Quick Look and Detailed View
- Opens incident-specific chat session
- Each incident can have its own dedicated AI analysis

### 3. **Updated Floating Chat Button**
- Always opens general security chat
- No longer affected by table row selection
- Title: "Open General AI Security Chat"

### 4. **Updated AIChatPanel Component**
- New props: `chatIncident` and `chatMode`
- Removed dependency on `selectedIncident`
- Dynamic header shows chat mode
- Clears messages when switching modes

### 5. **Backend Enhancement**
- Accepts `chatMode` parameter
- Adjusts AI prompt based on mode

## User Flows:

### 1. **General Security Chat (Floating Button)**
```
Click floating button → General chat opens
- Discusses all incidents
- Analyzes trends and patterns
- Not affected by table selections
```

### 2. **Incident-Specific Chat (Table Button)**
```
Click "AI Chat" in table → Focused chat opens
- Dedicated to that specific incident
- Deep dive analysis
- Incident ID shown in header
```

### 3. **Independent Operations**
- Table row selection only affects AI Threat Detection
- Chat sessions are completely independent
- Can have general chat while analyzing specific incident

## Visual Indicators:

| Feature | Indicator | Purpose |
|---------|-----------|---------|
| General Chat | "General Security Chat" header | Overall security discussion |
| Incident Chat | "Incident INC-XXX Analysis" header | Focused incident analysis |
| AI Chat Button | Purple color (#8b5cf6) | Distinguishes from other actions |

## Key Benefits:

1. **Clear Separation**: General vs incident-specific discussions
2. **No Interference**: Table selection doesn't affect chat context
3. **Multiple Contexts**: Can analyze different incidents in chat while viewing another
4. **Better UX**: Users always know what they're discussing

## Example Scenarios:

### Scenario 1: General Analysis
1. Click floating chat button
2. Ask: "What are the trends in recent incidents?"
3. AI analyzes all incidents in database

### Scenario 2: Specific Incident Deep Dive
1. See INC-001 in table
2. Click "AI Chat" button for INC-001
3. Ask: "What's the root cause?"
4. AI focuses only on INC-001 details

### Scenario 3: Mixed Usage
1. Select INC-001 for AI Threat Detection
2. Open general chat to ask about trends
3. Open AI Chat for INC-003 for specific analysis
4. All three features work independently

## Technical Details:

- **Chat Modes**: 'general' or 'incident'
- **Message Clearing**: Happens when switching modes
- **Context Passing**: Only passes incident data in incident mode
- **Welcome Messages**: Adapt based on mode

The implementation ensures complete independence between chat sessions and other AI features!
