# State Separation Implementation Summary

## Changes Made:

### 1. **Added New State Variable**
```javascript
const [quickLookIncident, setQuickLookIncident] = useState(null);
```

### 2. **Updated Quick Look Button**
- Now uses `setQuickLookIncident(incident)` instead of `setSelectedIncident`
- Quick Look modal is completely independent of AI features

### 3. **Updated Modal Display Logic**
- Modal shows when: `(quickLookIncident || selectedIncidentDetails)`
- Uses `quickLookIncident` for basic info display
- Uses `selectedIncidentDetails` for detailed report display

### 4. **Updated Modal Close Handlers**
- Clears `quickLookIncident` instead of `selectedIncident`
- AI selection remains active even when closing modal

## State Responsibilities:

| State | Purpose | Controls |
|-------|---------|----------|
| `selectedIncident` | AI features only | • Row highlighting<br>• Threat Intelligence<br>• AI Chat context |
| `quickLookIncident` | Quick Look modal | • Basic info modal display<br>• No row highlighting |
| `selectedIncidentDetails` | Detailed view | • Full report in modal |

## User Flows:

### 1. **AI Analysis Flow**
- Click table row → Sets `selectedIncident`
- Row highlights blue
- Threat Intelligence auto-shows
- AI Chat has context
- Modal does NOT open

### 2. **Quick Look Flow**
- Click Quick Look button → Sets `quickLookIncident`
- Modal opens with basic info
- NO row highlighting change
- AI features unchanged

### 3. **Detailed View Flow**
- Click Detailed View → Sets both `selectedIncident` and `selectedIncidentDetails`
- Modal opens with full report
- Row highlights blue
- AI features active

## Key Benefits:

1. **Independent Features**: Quick Look doesn't interfere with AI analysis
2. **Better UX**: Can view Quick Look while keeping AI analysis active
3. **Clear Separation**: Each state has single responsibility
4. **AI Chat Flexibility**: Works with or without selected incident

## Example Scenarios:

### Scenario 1: Analyzing INC-001
1. Select INC-001 (row click) → AI features active
2. Quick Look INC-002 → Modal shows INC-002
3. Close modal → INC-001 still selected for AI

### Scenario 2: No Selection
1. Quick Look any incident → Modal shows
2. No row highlighting
3. AI Chat works with all incidents

### Scenario 3: Mixed Usage
1. Select INC-001 → AI active
2. Detailed View INC-001 → Full report
3. Close modal → AI still active
4. Quick Look INC-003 → Shows without affecting INC-001 selection
